        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>FreedomForest aims to uplift and be a part of welcoming you to your new beginning.</p>
        <p>FreedomForest - receives information from Twitter’s API about user’s who have tweeted 
          that they have overcome life-threatening diseases/illnesses’ and plants a virtual tree/flower 
          for them in our larger virtual forest. The app is symbolic of a new life being given to these 
          people after overcoming their battle with cancer, COVID-19, etc and helps to spread positivity
          and support to the Twitter community. Also helps people talk about and see positivity about a 
          topic that would make people uncomfortable or feel sadness, but instead they can feel happy for 
          these people that are overcoming and adding to their new forest of life. Also aids in connecting 
          people who recently overcame with each other and can allow people going through it to have hope that 
          they too can overcome. </p>
