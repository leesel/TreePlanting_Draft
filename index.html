        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>FreedomForest aims to uplift and be a part of welcoming you to your new beginning.</p>
        <p>Because you have overcome a life-threatening disease/illness, we planted a virtual tree/flower 
          for you in our larger virtual forest. This is symbolic of a new life being given to these 
          people after overcoming their battle with cancer, COVID-19, etc and helps to spread positivity
          and support to the Twitter community. Also aids in connecting 
          people who recently overcame with each other and can allow people going through it to have hope that 
          they too can overcome. </p>
